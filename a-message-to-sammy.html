<h1>Dear Sammy Wammy,</h1>
<p>hey, sammy.. this is william whirlpoolaitr.. so sorry for leaving to go get the milk and not coming back for another 7 years.. it was because i left on black friday, there was no milk left, everyone had taken it. but there was one carton left so i had to fight for it but the guy i was fighting was a sigma alpha wolf and he captured me.. he is going to steal all of my social credit and aura points.. so i left the milk i created on this page for you to have. again i am so sorry for leaving on black friday, Siggity Sig Sigma Sammy Swamity Wammy.. you will never see me without a carton of milk.<br><br>this is your final milk</p>
